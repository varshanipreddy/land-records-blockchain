# land-records-blockchain
*PROBLEM STATEMENT* : 
Unlike developed countries, the property ownership details in developing countries isn't only inefficient, but is also error-prone and can be manipulated. Also several malpractices still exist in the system just due to lack of a transparent and immutable system. Therefore, we propose a Blockchain based solution to curb the flaws of the existing system.  

*BLOCKCHAIN BASED REAL ESTATE PROPERTY REGISTRATION APP* :
A smart app for property registration and ownership tracking. The property value and owner is stored on blockchain and features like change of ownership is easily reflected through this mechanism. Administrators with varying degree of controls like User, Admin, Superadmin secure the governance.  
The smart contracts are developed for the ethereum blockchain which is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts.  

Technical Details :
High Level Languages for smart developing contract :  
Solidity  

Command Line Tool for creating a DAPP project : 
Truffle Testnode with RPC Interface for deploying contracts on a virtual node and make transactions without the need to be mined.
